# Linux Scripts

This is a collection of Linux scripts that I use in my day to day activity. This is continuously being updated and improved as I
create more and more scripts.

**NOTE: These scripts do not end in .sh because they are symbolically linked to my /usr/local/bin/ folder so that I can execute
them simply by typing their name (and for tab auto-complete :])**

If you decide you would like to use any of these scripts, it is recommended that you either add the scripts/ to your $PATH variable
or sym link them to something that is in your $PATH variable.
